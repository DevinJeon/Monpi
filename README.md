# Monpi

**You can enjoy it on [here](http://monpi.hyojun.me)!**

The name comes from "**몬**(Mon)스터 **피**(pi)하기", the Korean word for "Dodge Monsters".

Monpi is my first game project and an output from one of the onboarding processes, "Making a game for two weeks", at NEXON I worked before.

At that time, I had never experienced something like game design, game development process and Unity. Even though it was a just small project during the short period, it helped me to understand how we create a game, and to settle in the game development company.

## How to play

*At least, I couldn't see anyone cleared all stages(total 10 stages)*

* **Right click to move units**(just like StarCraft)
* **Dodge the monsters and head upwards to reach the white circle destination**
* You will be given bonus time on each stage. The faster you reach within bonus time, the more score you get.
* You can't play this game on mobile or some browsers because it's built on WebGL
